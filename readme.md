# Pokémon CLIDown 
A Pokémon Battle Simulator over Telnet 
Done for my final project for CS5283 Computer Networks

Like Pokémon Showdown but over Telnet

Current features
- Hardcoded one on one battle of Treeko vs Bidoof
- Simplified battle engine based on https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damage (including the .85 -1 damage range of damage)
- Moves actually have PP that goes down
- Moves can miss (razor leaf)


Coming soon
- STAB (same type attack boost)
